# 🌾 Blockchain Ledger for Microfinance Repayment Tracking

Welcome to a revolutionary blockchain solution designed to empower unbanked farmers globally! This project uses the Stacks blockchain to create a transparent, immutable ledger for tracking microfinance loans and repayments. By building verifiable credit histories, it helps farmers access better financial opportunities, reduces default risks for lenders, and fosters economic inclusion in rural communities.

## ✨ Features

📊 Immutable repayment tracking for loans
💳 Build and query credit histories on-chain
🌍 Support for global unbanked users with simple registration
🔄 Automated credit score updates based on repayment behavior
🤝 Lender-farmer matching and loan disbursement
⚖️ Dispute resolution mechanism
📈 Integration with oracles for real-world data (e.g., crop yields)
🔒 Secure token-based transactions using fungible tokens

## 🛠 How It Works

This project leverages Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain to handle all aspects of microfinance. The system involves 8 interconnected smart contracts to ensure security, transparency, and scalability. Here's a high-level overview:

### Smart Contracts Overview

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Handles registration of farmers and lenders, storing user profiles (e.g., identity hashes, location data) and verifying uniqueness to prevent fraud.

2. **LoanOrigination.clar**: Allows lenders to create loan offers and farmers to accept them. It records loan terms like amount, interest rate, duration, and disburses funds via tokens.

3. **RepaymentTracker.clar**: Tracks scheduled and actual repayments. Farmers submit payments, which are logged immutably, updating loan status in real-time.

4. **CreditHistory.clar**: Maintains a ledger of each farmer's repayment history. It aggregates data from repayments to build a comprehensive credit profile.

5. **CreditScoreCalculator.clar**: Computes dynamic credit scores based on history (e.g., on-time payments, defaults). Uses simple algorithms to assign scores that evolve over time.

6. **CollateralManager.clar**: Manages digital collateral (e.g., NFTs representing assets like equipment or land titles) that can be locked during loans and released upon full repayment.

7. **DisputeResolution.clar**: Enables arbitration for disputes, allowing third-party verifiers to review evidence and resolve issues, updating the ledger accordingly.

8. **OracleIntegrator.clar**: Integrates external data feeds (e.g., weather or market prices) to assess loan risks or trigger insurance-like adjustments in repayment terms.

### For Farmers

- Register your profile using UserRegistry.
- Browse and accept loan offers via LoanOrigination.
- Make repayments through RepaymentTracker – each on-time payment boosts your credit score in CreditScoreCalculator.
- Query your credit history anytime with CreditHistory to share with potential lenders.

Boom! You're building a verifiable credit profile that opens doors to larger loans and better terms.

### For Lenders

- Register and create loan offers in LoanOrigination.
- Monitor repayments in real-time via RepaymentTracker.
- Verify farmer credit scores using CreditScoreCalculator before approving loans.
- Handle any issues with DisputeResolution for fair outcomes.

That's it! Transparent lending with reduced risks.

### For Verifiers/Institutions

- Use CreditHistory and CreditScoreCalculator to assess farmer eligibility for programs.
- Integrate OracleIntegrator for data-driven decisions, like adjusting terms based on crop forecasts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install the Clarity development tools and Stacks wallet.
2. Deploy the contracts in sequence (start with UserRegistry).
3. Interact via the Stacks explorer or build a simple frontend dApp.
4. Test with sample loans: Register users, originate a loan, simulate repayments, and watch credit scores update!

This project tackles the real-world challenge of financial exclusion for over 1 billion unbanked individuals, particularly farmers, by providing a tamper-proof system for credit building. Let's cultivate financial growth together! 🌱
